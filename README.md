# SQL Queries

  
  ### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#npm-start-or-yarn-start) for more information.

<strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT :-</strong>

Create, design and implement a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query. The application must include a space which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application..

    

**TECHNOLOGIES :-**

 Framework: <code><img height="50" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/reactjs/reactjs-ar21.svg" title="React"></code></br>

<strong>OVERVIEW:-</strong>
It is a basic web application prototype that can conduct SQL queries and display the rows of any given dataset. I obtained the data by converting csv files to json files, which can then be re-rendered using SQL queries.

<strong>PERFORMANCE AND LOAD TIME:-</strong></br>
- I used the google Lighthouse open-source tool for the performance check, this automated tool for help me to improving the performance, quality, and correctness of my web apps. 
- For load time check I used chrome's developer tool "Chrome -> Right Click -> Inspect Element -> Network Tab"
